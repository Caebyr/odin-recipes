    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pesto or more fully pesto alla genovese is a paste made of crushed garlic, pine nuts, salt, basil leaves, grated cheese such as Parmesan or pecorino sardo, and olive oil. It originated in the Italian city of Genoa, and is used to dress pasta and flavour genoese minestrone soup.</p>
    <p>You can use it to easily upgrade fish, salads and breadâ€”or make a big batch of pesto pasta.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend up a batch of my 6-ingredient basil pesto, or use store-bought pesto in a pinch.</li>
        <li>Cook your pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package directions</li>
        <li>Before draining the pasta, reserve some of the starchy pasta water. Then, add 1/4 cup of this pasta water back into the pot with your pesto, and stir to thin the pesto.</li>
        <li>Toss in the cooked pasta, and mix until the pesto thoroughly coats it.</li>
        <li>Add a big handful of arugula and toss until it's barely wilted.</li>
        <li>Finish everything with a big squeeze of lemon, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and toasted pine nuts.</li>
    </ol>
